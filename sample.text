Text mining is a component of data mining that deals specifically with unstructured text data. It involves the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract useful information and insights from large amounts of unstructured text data. Text mining can be used as a preprocessing step for data mining or as a standalone process for specific tasks. 
Text mining in data mining is mostly used for, the unstructured text data that can be transformed into structured data that can be used for data mining tasks such as classification, clustering, and association rule mining. This allows organizations to gain insights from a wide range of data sources, such as customer feedback, social media posts, and news articles.
Text mining and text analytics are related but distinct processes for extracting insights from textual data. Text mining involves the application of natural language processing and machine learning techniques to discover patterns, trends, and knowledge from large volumes of unstructured text.

However, Text Analytics focuses on extracting meaningful information, sentiments, and context from text, often using statistical and linguistic methods. While text mining emphasizes uncovering hidden patterns, text analytics emphasizes deriving actionable insights for decision-making. Both play crucial roles in transforming unstructured text into valuable knowledge, with text mining exploring patterns and text analytics providing interpretative context.
Text mining is widely used in various fields, such as natural language processing, information retrieval, and social media analysis. It has become an essential tool for organizations to extract insights from unstructured text data and make data-driven decisions.
Text mining is a process of extracting useful information and nontrivial patterns from a large volume of text databases. There exist various strategies and devices to mine the text and find important data for the prediction and decision-making process. The selection of the right and accurate text mining procedure helps to enhance the speed and the time complexity also. This article briefly discusses and analyzes text mining and its applications in diverse fields.

As we discussed above, the size of information is expanding at exponential rates. Today all institutes, companies, different organizations, and business ventures are stored their information electronically. A huge collection of data is available on the internet and stored in digital libraries, database repositories, and other textual data like websites, blogs, social media networks, and e-mails. It is a difficult task to determine appropriate patterns and trends to extract knowledge from this large volume of data. Text mining is a part of Data mining to extract valuable text information from a text database repository. Text mining is a multi-disciplinary field based on data recovery, Data mining, AI,statistics, Machine learning, and computational linguistics.
